        <p className='text-white'>Hello! My name is Harshal Atre. I enjoy creating things that live
on the internet. My interest in web development started  in 2022
when I decided to try editing custom Tumblr themes â€” turns out
hacking together a custom reblog button taught me a lot about HTML & CSS</p>
        <p className='text-white'>Fast-forward to today. and I've had the privilege of working at an
advertising agency, a start-up, a huge corporation, and a student-led
design studio. My maln focus these days is building accessible, inclusive
products and digital experiences at Upstatement for a variety of clients. I
also recently launched a course that covers everything you need to build
a web app with the Spotify API using Node & React.</p>
